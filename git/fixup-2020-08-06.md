# Fix commit and autosquash

I like to make small commits with meaningful messages. Often I change something that I would like to add to previous commits.

If I want to add the changes to the latest commit, it's easy: `git commit --amend`, but if not, it requires a rebase later. I used to reuse the commit messages, to make it easy to know which commits should be squashed together.



**And today I learned: `git commit --fixup <commit hash>`**



This command will reuse the message of `<commit hash>` prefixed with `fixup!`, like this:

```shel
$ git commit --fixup bbb2222

$ git log --online
ddd4444 (HEAD, my-feature-branch) fixup! A second commit
ccc3333 A third commit
bbb2222 A second commit
aaa1111 A first commit
9999999 (main) last commit on main
```



Then, **the magic**:

1. When you want, just run `git rebase --interactive --autoquash <parent branch>`
2. The editor will open with the correct order and already marked with the `fixup` action.
3. Just confirm and that's it!
