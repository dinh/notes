Assuming that you are in your branch:

```shell

```

```

To check the status:

```shell
git diff --name-status <another-branch>
```

where values are:

```
A        - Added
C<score> - Copied
D        - Deleted 
M        - Modified

T        - Type changed (i.e. regular file, symlink, submodule, â€¦)  
U        - Unmerged
